# query-gen

A web search query generator for searching multiple sites at once.  

Currently queries are formatted for DuckDuckGo specifically, but they may work with other search engines as well.

# Usage

	- Install dependencies from requirements.txt
	
	- Run qgen.pyw

	- To customize your own sites or add more, see the "checkboxes" section of the script and change the strings for each checkbox object.  I may add this customization to the UI at some point.
	
# Dependencies

	- icecream
	- customtkinter
	- pyperclip
